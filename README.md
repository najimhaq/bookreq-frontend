## Overview

Bookreq is a full-stack library platform designed around a calm, intentional reading experience. Readers can organize personal libraries, monitor reading progress, and keep their book collection in one place. Administrators get a secure command center to manage users, books, and authors across the platform.

The project emphasizes a premium interface, responsive interactions, typed APIs, and role-based access control.

## Highlights

### Reader experience

- Build and organize a personal reading library.
- Track each book as **Want to Read**, **Reading**, or **Completed**.
- Browse book and author information in a focused, responsive interface.
- Maintain a personal profile and account session.

### Admin workspace

- Live overview of total users, books, and authors.
- Recent book activity and recently registered users.
- Searchable, filterable, paginated book management.
- Searchable, filterable, paginated user management.
- Author catalogue with book counts, search, pagination, and author creation.
- Role-aware navigation: administrative catalogue access is shown only to admins.

### Product details

- Responsive layouts for desktop and mobile.
- Outside-click and `Escape` support for navigation menus.
- Loading skeletons, empty states, inline errors, and toast feedback.
- Optimistic UI update after author creation.
- External cover and profile images rendered with Next Image.

## Application areas

```text
/
├── Landing page
├── /dashboard
│   └── Reader workspace
├── /dashboard/books
│   └── Personal library
├── /profile
│   └── Reader profile
└── /admin
    ├── Dashboard overview
    ├── /admin/users
    ├── /admin/books
    └── /admin/authors
```

## Role-based access

Bookreq separates reader and administrator experiences.

| Capability | Reader | Admin |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Manage personal reading library | Yes | Yes |
| View profile | Yes | Yes |
| View admin dashboard | No | Yes |
| Manage platform users | No | Yes |
| Review all books | No | Yes |
| Manage author catalogue | No | Yes |

> Hiding an admin link in the UI improves navigation clarity, but it is not security. Protected API routes and admin pages must also verify authorization on the server.

## API endpoints

### Admin

```http
GET  /api/admin/dashboard
GET  /api/admin/users?page=1&limit=10&search=&role=
GET  /api/admin/books?page=1&limit=10&search=&status=
GET  /api/admin/authors?page=1&limit=10&search=
POST /api/admin/authors
```

### Create an author

```http
POST /api/admin/authors
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Haruki Murakami",
  "bio": "Japanese novelist, short-story writer, and translator."
}
```

## Environment variables

### Frontend — `.env.local`

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

### Backend — `.env`

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DATABASE"
```

Add the authentication provider variables required by your chosen session/auth setup as well. Never commit real credentials.

## Local development

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

Install dependencies in both frontend and backend directories:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Configure environment files

Create the frontend `.env.local` and backend `.env` files using the variables above.

### 3. Set up the database

From the backend directory:

```bash
yarn prisma migrate dev
yarn prisma generate
```

Optionally load seed data:

```bash
yarn prisma db seed
```

### 4. Start the application

Run the backend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Run the frontend in a separate terminal:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Frontend API convention

The frontend uses a shared Axios client:

```ts
export const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL ?? 'http://localhost:8000/api',
  withCredentials: true,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});
```

With `/api` included in `baseURL`, feature helpers remain concise:

```ts
apiClient.get('/admin/dashboard');
apiClient.get('/admin/users?page=1&limit=10');
apiClient.post('/admin/authors', payload);
```

## UI principles

- **Quiet confidence** — calm surfaces, intentional spacing, and readable hierarchy.
- **Fast feedback** — skeletons during loading and toast messages for completed actions.
- **Clear state** — empty, error, disabled, and pagination states are treated as first-class UI.
- **Responsive by default** — administrative tables preserve layout with horizontal scrolling where necessary.
- **Accessible interactions** — menus close on outside pointer interaction and the `Escape` key.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Edit author details.
- [ ] Delete authors with linked-book safeguards.
- [ ] Admin role promotion and demotion flow.
- [ ] Book moderation actions.
- [ ] Dashboard reading-status analytics.
- [ ] Author and book detail pages.
- [ ] Automated tests for API authorization and core UI flows.

## Project status

Actively under development. The admin dashboard, user management, book management, author catalogue, author creation flow, and responsive navigation foundation are in place.

Built for readers who want their library to feel as considered as the books inside it.
